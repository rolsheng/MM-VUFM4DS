# Delving into Multi-modal Multi-task Foundation Models for Road Scene Understanding: From Learning Paradigm Perspectives
 **Abstract:** Foundation models have indeed made a profound
impact on various fields, emerging as pivotal components that
significantly shape the capabilities of intelligent systems. In the
context of intelligent vehicles, leveraging the power of foundation
models has proven to be transformative, offering notable advancements in visual understanding. Equipped with multi-modal
and multi-task learning capabilities, multi-modal multi-task visual understanding foundation models (MM-VUFMs) effectively
process and fuse data from diverse modalities and simultaneously
handle various driving-related tasks with powerful adaptability,
contributing to a more holistic understanding of the surrounding
scene. In this survey, we present a systematic analysis of MMVUFMs specifically designed for road scenes. Our objective is not
only to provide a comprehensive overview of common practices,
referring to task-specific models, unified multi-modal models,
unified multi-task models, and foundation model prompting
techniques, but also to highlight their advanced capabilities
in diverse learning paradigms. These paradigms include openworld understanding, efficient transfer for road scenes, continual
learning, interactive and generative capability. Moreover, we
provide insights into key challenges and future trends, such as
closed-loop driving systems, interpretability, embodied driving
agents, and world models.
